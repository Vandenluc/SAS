# SAS Repository

Welcome to my SAS repository! This will be the hub where I showcase all of my projects. The current projects were assignments from my Econometrics classes at York University (Econ 4140 and Econ 4220). 

So far the structure consists of 3 Folders:

1. Code - Source code for each project.
2. Data - The data complementing the code.
3. Reports - Final conclusions drawn from inferences in the data written in LaTeX. 

My goal will be to expand this with new projects and proper reports. Areas I'd like to expand into include learning Power BI to improve reports, and 

Finally, I'd like to thank my professor Joann Jasiak for all of her help. She inspired me to push myself to be a both better programmer and data scientist. and this repository wouldn't have been possible without her. Please check her work out at http://www.jjstats.com/, she is an awesome person.
